# GLM

The General Lake Model (GLM) is a water balance and one-dimensional vertical stratification
hydrodynamic model. It accounts for the effect of inflows/outflows, mixing and surface heating
and cooling, including the effect of ice cover. It is suited to longer-term investigations
ranging from seasons to decades, and for coupling with biogeochemical models to explore the
role that stratification and vertical mixing has on biogeochemical and ecological dynamics of lakes.
