This should be in the v4alpha branch

This includes the new api and particle tracking and a bunch of fixes
Unfortunately, the new API only works properly when built with ifort, not gfortran

Specifically, the problem occurs when setting the environment ; in glm_api_aed.F90 we
do :

      area => theLake%LayerArea

then :

      aed_env%area => area

and:

      CALL aed_set_model_env(aed_env)

Then in libaed-api aed_api.F90 in aed_set_model_env we do:

      area         => env%area

Now; if we fill the first 10 elements of area with numbers eg :

do i=1,10
  area(i) = 100.0 + i
enddo

and print these before the call aed_set_model_env  all is OK, but then in aed_set_model_env we
print those values in area (after recovering the pointer) we get junk

This does not happen with ifort ... so either its something done wrong that ifort allows or there is a bug in gfortran.
