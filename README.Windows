We build GLM on windows using "chocolatey". 

After installing choco (see https://chocolatey.org/install ) install these packages :

          choco install -y make
          choco install -y mingw
          choco install -y git
          choco install -y cmake --installargs 'ADD_CMAKE_TO_PATH=System'

After which the build script ( build_glm.sh ) can be used in a "Git Bash" shell
which should fetch and build some 3rd party libraries in the ancillary directory
before building GLM
